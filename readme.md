I decided to take a simple approach and use an array with conditionals to build a
quote trivia game.

My original idea was to have five characters that rotated through each "round", but
I ended up biting off more than I can do so I scaled back and used just one character
to make sure I had a finished project that worked.

In the future, I would like to include those with images that pop up reacting to the
users answer as well as snappier CSS, but overall I'm happy with this finished product.


As is stands, the user will be presented with a quote and will have the option of selecting
who they think said the quote by clicking on either the photo of Bender or Trump.
They will be informed on whether the guess was correct or incorrect with an
incremental counter displaying their score after every round. The game will last
for twenty quotes and will end with a reminder to vote in the New York primaries. 




The preliminary mockup can be seen below. As this is a straightforward game,
a straightforward design seemed to make the most sense.
